### Linear Algebra
# It is the branch of mathematics that deals with
# vector spacces

## Vector
# Vectors are objects that can be added together and that
# can be multiplied by scalars, also to form new vectors

# * List is not vector in python

###### zip-ing the vectors together and using a list 
###### comprehension to add the corresponding elements
def vector_add(v, w):
    return [v_i + w_i
            for v_i, w_i in zip(v, w)]

print(zip([1,2], [3,4]))
print(vector_add([1,2], [3,4]))

def vector_sub(v, w):
    return [v_i - w_i
            for v_i, w_i in zip(v, w)]
print(vector_sub([1,2], [3,4]))

def vector_sum(vector):
    result = vector[0]
    for v in vector[1:]:
        result = vector_add(result, v)
    return result

vector1 = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [4,5]]
print(vector_sum(vector1))

### What is the reduce function??? ###
def vector_sum2(vector):
    return reduce(vector_add, vector)
print(vector_sum2(vector1))
# To make a result from list about computation.
