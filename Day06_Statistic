###Statistic

# Describing a single set of data

## Mean is the average in data set

## Median is the Midpoint where the data set is
# 1. Sorting as ascending order
# 2. Find the mid point
# Even case: Value of mid + mid-1 and divide by 2
# Odd case : Value of mid point

## Mode is the value which frequently occur

## Dispersion
#  It refers to measure of how spread out our data
#  Which values near zero signify not spread out at
#  all and for which large values signify very
#  spread out

def data_range(x):
    return max(x) - min(x)

# If max(x) and min(x) are equal zero, which can happen
# if the elements of x are all the same.(Unspread)

# Median : the range doesn't really depend on the
# whole data set.

# More complex measure of dispersion is the variance

# Translate x by subtracting its mean
def de_mean(x):
    x_bar = mean(x)
    return [x_i - x_bar for x_i in x]

def sum_of_squares(v):
	return sum(v_i ** 2 for v_i in v)

def variance(x):
    n = len(x)
    deviations = de_mean(x)
    return sum_of_squares(deviations) / (n-1)

# the standard deviation is a measure that is
# used to quantify the amount of variation or
# dispersion of a set of data values.
def standard_deviation(x):
    return math.sqrt(variance(x))



#### Correlation

# It show up the relationship between two data which made as matrix
## Covariance : the paried analogue of variance
# In other words, it show up how prbability values are spread out.
# The variable spread out at 1, 3 axis : Positive Relationship
# The variable spread out at 2, 4 axis : Negative Relationship
# The variable spread out at every axis : No Relationship

# Formula : Dot( standard_deviation of x data and y data ) and divide by number of data x
#           * Dot : mulitply of two matrix

## Correlation : The correlation is unitless and always lies between -1 (perfect anti-correlation) and 1
# (perfect correlation)
# Why we need a correlation
# 1. Its units are the product of input's units, which can be hard to make sense of.
# 2. If each user had twice as many frds, the covariance would be twice as large
#    but, in a sense the variable would be just as interrelated.

# Formula : Covariance(x, y) / standard_deviation x * standard_deviation y
