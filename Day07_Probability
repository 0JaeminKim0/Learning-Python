### The case for probablity Independence and conditional


import random

def random_kid():
    return random.choice(["boy", "girl"])

both_girl = 0
older_girl = 0
either_girl = 0

random.seed(0)
for _ in range(100):
    younger = random_kid()
    older = random_kid()
    if older == "girl":
        older_girl += 1
    if older == "girl" and younger == "girl":
        both_girl += 1
    if older == "girl" or younger == "girl":
        either_girl += 1
    print(older_girl, both_girl, either_girl)
    print("P(both | older): ", both_girl // older_girl)
    print("P(both | either): ", both_girl // either_girl)

#print(random_kid())


## Bayes Theorem
# There is the probability of some event E conditional on some other event F
# occuring that we need to know. But we only have information about the probability
# of F conditional on E occuring.
# P(E|F) = P(E, F) / P(F) = P(F|E)P(E)/P(F)
# P(F) = P(F, E) + P(F, ㄱE)
# P(E|F) = P(F|E)P(E)/[P(F, E) + P(F, ㄱE)]
