### List Comprehension
# For transforming a list into another list
# By choosing only certain elements
# or both

# even number list
even_no = [x for x in range(5) if x % 2 is 0]
squares = [x * x for x in range(5)]
even_squares = [x * x for x in even_no]

#print even_no, squares, even_squares

zeroes = [0 for _ in even_no]
print zeroes

# multiple for in a list comprehension

pairs = [(x,y)
         for x in range(3)
         for y in range(3)]
print pairs

# later for can use the results of earlier ones:
# the case for x < y
increasing_pairs = [(x,y)
                    for x in range(4)
                    for y in range(x+1, 4)]
print increasing_pairs
